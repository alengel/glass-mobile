# glass-mobile

This repository is a mobile application that runs on Android phones. When it is running, it establishes a Bluetooth connection to Google Glass. It acts as a mobile server to any requests that come from Google Glass. It makes HTTP requests to the Brandwatch and Semantics3 APIs, receives data and processes it into HTML Glass cards before passing the data on to Google Glass. 

This application works only together with it's counterpart on Glass, which can be found here: https://github.com/alengel/glass-bluetooth

<b>How to use this repository:</b>
<br/>
Get the repo. Open it in Eclipse and run it on an Android phone, it should work just as is. It is missing the Brandwatch & Semantics3 credentials, which you will have to replace. Contact me if you have any questions.
